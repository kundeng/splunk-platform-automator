# This playbook manages the /etc/hosts file for all hosts
#
# NOTE: This is a fallback mechanism for when Terraform is not used to manage the infrastructure.
# The primary method for managing hosts is through Terraform, which generates the inventory/hosts file.
# This fallback is useful in scenarios where:
# 1. You're working with existing infrastructure not managed by Terraform
# 2. You need to manually specify host mappings
# 3. You're running Ansible independently of the Terraform workflow
